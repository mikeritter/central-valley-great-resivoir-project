# Central Valley Great Resivoir Project

 A proposal to establish a robust resivoir system to accommodate California's dynamic swings between drought and deluge

## Executive Summary

This Great Resiovoir Project mirrors the great dam erection project of State and Federal governments on the early twentieth century. In my home state of Arkansas, these dams serve as resivoirs for municipalities, agriculture, recreation, and wildlife. The significant investment and sacrifice made a century ago has yielded great benefits for residents, visitors, and municipalities over the years and promises to do so for years to come.

The Great Resivoirs will serve to reduce California's dependence on outside sources for water. At the same time they will serve as sentinels for the Central Valley's thriving agriculture and residential communities. These resivoirs can be engineered to offset the effects of extreme drought and flood: diverting runoff, sifting and purifying the runoff as it flows along, generating electricity, and storing the resulting water for immediate dispersal or future use.

While the impact on both natural habitat and human infrastructure may face resistance, previous large-scale infrastructure projects have proven communities can overcome these obstacles when presented the clear benefits to everyone involved.

The Great Resivoir Project entails a network of modest and robust resivoirs strategically placed to accommodate the effifient diversion and processing of runoff from extreme precipitation events designed to sustain overwhelming deluge as well as indefinitely-prolonged precipitation. It is designed primarily to address precipitation in the immediate area, but can handle runoff from excessive snow melt or other events outside the area.

Upstream collection and removal, retention, and disposal of physical and chemical pollutants is paramount in the successful creation of potable and usable water resivoirs downstream. It is therefore essential to identify origin points where raw runoff can be diverted and introduced into the system. Likewise, it is important to design these origin points in cascading fashion where no single origin point is overwhelmed, but automatically diverts excessive flow down to the next origin point. This can be achieved with locks and dams which maintain an optimal level and flow of water and debris.

These origin points lie along main arteries with tributaries that feed runoff along the region toward its termination. Off these arteries branch successive series of physical and chemical filtration systems that clarify the runoff as they predictively distribute the waste material for processing and product to municipalities for final processing, storage, or treatment.

As runoff flows along the path, it activates various hyrdo and chemical power generation stations to produce energy to sustain the system and replenish the power grid.

Various communities within California's Central Valley can utilize the water and byproducts as they deem suitable. The goal of the Project is not to create an alternative source of water for the coastal regions of the state nor to replace the contentious and fragile agreements to supply water from neighboring regions. Its aim is to prepare for and prevent the devastating results of catastrophic flooding and protect resivoirs of water for times of catastrophic drought.
